    <h1>Basic Introduction</h1>
    <p>Enzymes are responsible for speeding up chemical reactions. In other words, they are catalysts that bind to other substances called substrates. The majority of them are classified as proteins, while others as RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules.
        </p>

        <p2>Thousands of enzymes are found within each cell which enables the human body to properly respirate, digest food and detoxify itself. They do this by breaking down larger molecules into smaller molecules so that they can be absorbed. In short, enzymes combine with other molecules to start a chemical reaction. 
        </p2>

    <h1>Quick Analogy</h1>
    <p>Since enzymes can bind with substrates, it can also be interpreted as Pacman eating the golden pelettes. The section where they connect is known as the active site.
